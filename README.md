[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/rlabbe/ThinkBayes)


This material was adapted Roger from Roger Labbe's repository
which he addapted from Allen Downey's Think Bayes 
Github repository. 

I took the Roger's notebooks as a template and rewrote
the code from scratch. The reason for this was that
due to class inheritance and polymorphism I could not fully
unterstand how the calculations were performed. I mostly used
numpy and scipy and made each notebook self-contained. 

I did my best to figure out the calculations but at some
points there is something off with my results. I made remarks
when it is the case.
